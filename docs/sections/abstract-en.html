<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This application level ontology is intended to provide the framework for answering questions like:

1. "How can EarthCube help me?" (Science Engagement), 
2. "If I had an EarthCube Workbench, what capabilities could I access through it?" (Workbench) and 
3. “What EarthCube software components can I use to get my application working?” (Developers). 

It extends the idea of an EarthCube Registry beyond data sets, to a generalized Registry of software components, semantic resources, tools, etc., with descriptive information to facilitate evaluation for reuse.</span>
