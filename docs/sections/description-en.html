<span class="markdown">
This ontology was developed to support a prototype of a generalized registry of software components, semantic resources, tools, etc., with descriptive information to facilitate evaluation for reuse and where feasible to directly connect data with services, tools, and other capabilities to facilitate working with them. The registry enables capabilities developed through NSF's EarthCube Program (EC) to be registered and exposed for both science research usage, and for software developers building applications to support research. Knowing what components are available is a prerequisite for reuse of existing work. This ontology allows for the development of resource documentation that has consistent content and uses consistent vocabularies.  This will facilitate the discovery process and evaluation of fitness for use. 

The directory structure for this ontology was originally started using the OBO Foundry's [ontology starter kit] (https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-starter-kit) with the original intent to:

- Submit the developed ontology to the OBO Foundry for curation and access,
- Develop an ontology that is harmonized with OBO Foundry, W3C, schema.org, and ESIP COR ontologies and conventions.

However, these long-term goals needed to be modified for this short term prototype effort.  Specifically the ontology has been hosted in the ESIP COR repository along with all of the controlled vocabularies developed.  In addition, some of the harmonization effort has been deferred to later iterations.

One of the primary goals of the prototype effort was to produce schema.org representations of EC resources, while maintaining the structures and compliance with the W3C ontologies - in particular DCAT 2 and PROV-O.  This goal has largely been achieved as depicted below where you can see how the schema.org terms CreativeWork, Intangible, and Defined Term relate to EarthCube specializations of the DCAT Catalog Record, Dataset, and Cataloged Resource.

In addition a wide variety of included controlled vocabularies developed to support the user interfaces for resource metadata submission, query and access. Vocabularies developed in support of this work are hosted on the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners [Community Ontology Repository] (http://cor.esipfed.org/).  See image below.
